```

   - Calculates optimal price
   - Predicts demand change
   - Estimates revenue impact
   - Provides reasoning

3. **Recommendations:**
   - "Increase Heritage Hoodie from $145 to $152"
   - "Expected: 21 units/day, 66% margin"
   - "Reasoning: Competitor avg $158, you have room"

4. **Scenarios:**

**Dashboard Shows:**

Revenue - COGS = Gross Profit
Gross Profit - Expenses = Net Profit
```

```
REVENUE                    $245,830
